# golang-webserver-to-mqtt
Post JSON to a GoLang Webserver and publish it in MQTT

## Usage
You can use this Webserver to post JSON to it and it will publish it in MQTT.
My usecase was using it as a CSGO Game State Integration (CSGO GSI).

This way it came into MQTT and I could automate faster, as all my IOT is in MQTT.

## How to build:
I used GoLang 1.20.1, and just did "go build main.go" to build it.

## Disclaimer
This is my first try at building in GoLang. I'm sure there are better ways to do this.
